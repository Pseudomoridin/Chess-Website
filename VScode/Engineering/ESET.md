# ESET
## *Compsci major's second choice*

## ESET
### *Discount compsci*
- Much more of a practical application to compsci
- "What does this button do?"
- Much, much more of a versatile degree
- Very much so to do with physical things, less so software
- Same results as EE, different training
    - ESET is applied, not theoretical
    - Learn through experimentation
- Curriculum includes mostly "real world" classes
- Every ESET class has a lab
- Capstone is extremely hands-on
    - Made up of two courses:
        - Project management
        - Building project
- This is an engineering degree
    - Engineer, not a technician
- You **can** work for the "big" companies
- You **can** go to grad school

## 5 fields of ESET studies
- Analog circuits
- Embedded systems
- Wired/Wireless comms
- Systems
- Real world applications

### ***Potentially a good minor, talk with someone about figuring out if that is possible lol***
