# Computer Science and Computer Engineering
## *What I wanna do*

## Compsci vs BA Computing
- Capstone project at the end, electives & all sorts of fun stuff
- Compsci takes pretty much all the same classes as BA Computing only BA is easier

## Cybersecurity minor
- Through the cybersecurity center, about 17 hours, doesn't require many additional classes

## ETAM
- Pick CPSC/CPEN as FIRST choice
- Don't wait until after ETAM to sign up for classes
- If you can't get into a course, submit a course/force request <!-- Idk which he's saying but it's one of them -->

### ***I'm gonna enjoy this major***
