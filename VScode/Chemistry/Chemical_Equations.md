# **Chemistry 107**
## *With Dr. Christian Hilty*

## Chemical reactions
### *Things turn into other things*
- Reactants go to products
- Lists **every** molecule involved (except maybe catalysts)
- Shows how much is needed and how much is made

<br><br>

## Precipitation reactions
### *2 liquids that then turn into a solid*
- Occur in solution from dissolved ionic compounds, form a precipitate (solid from two aqueous solutions)
- Net ionic is the two aqueous ions that combine into a solid precipitate

<br><br>

## Acid-Base reactions
### *Oh god oh heck please don't make me calculate equilibrium*
- acids produce H+ in water (technically hydronium, H3O+)
- bases produce OH- in water
- strong vs weak acids/bases
    - strong dissociate completely in solution - only the ions are produced
    - weak partially dissociate in solution- the acid/base is still present
- when reacted together, acids and bases produce:
    - both strong- ionic salt and water <!-- Typically referred to as "neutralization" -->
    - strong acid weak base- 
    - strong base weak acid- 
    - both weak-  <!-- NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE NIGHTMARE PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T MAKE ME DO EQUILIBRIUM EQUATIONS AND RICE TABLES -->

## Combustion reactions
### *Burn Burn Boom Boom*
