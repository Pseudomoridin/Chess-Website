## Gasses
### *Flying around at the speed of sound*
- Gasses do not have definite volume or shape
- Gasses have very low densities that vary with changing conditions
- Gasses can easily mix with each other
- Gasses have dramatic volume changes with varying temperature (Since at higher temperatures, molecules move faster)
- Absolute Zero is when pressure is infinite and volume is zero
