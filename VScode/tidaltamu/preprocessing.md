## Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence
- Preprocessing is very important, 90% of all data science
- Preprocessing is
    - Data Cleaning
    - Data Transformation
    - Data Reduction
- Data Cleaning
    - Get rid of bad data like big outliers and empty values
    - Duplicate Data
        - Messes up neural networks
    - Updated Data
    - Untrustworthy Data
    - Noisy Data
        - "What is happening" data
- Data Transformation
    - Remove or replace?
    - Normalization
        - Raising differences to see it better
    - Feature Selection
        - Deciding which variables & features are important
- Data Reduction
    - Data is expensive
    - Principal Component Analysis
    - Attribute Selection
- Libraries for preprocessing
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
- Preprocessing in Classification data
    - Word embending
        - Assign words a vector, catagorizes them into similar groups
        - Different words can have different meanings but still be in the same catagory
<br><br>
- Current AI Implementation
    - Catagorizing abstracts

## Mini project
- Obtain a COVID dataset
- Find info and statistics about delta variant & back it up with data
- Do preprocessing, graph data and let ppl know about stuff
- Find some way to add machine learning
- Find your own data BUT:
    - github good, use raw or read from CSV
