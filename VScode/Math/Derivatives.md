## Derivatives
### *Fancy slopes*
- lim h -> 0 (f(x+h) - f(X)) / h
- Power rule:
    - multiply by the exponent and decrease exponent by 1
- Derivative of a piecewise function
    - do each piece individually
    - find out where function is discontinuous
    - find out where derivative is discontinuous
- Product rule
    - f'(x) = g(x)h'(x) + g'(x)h(x)
- Quotient rule
    - (bottom(x)top'(x) - bottom'(x)top(x)) / bottom(x)^2
