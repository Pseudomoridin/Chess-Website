## Limits
### *Range and Domain*
- lim x->0 = 4
- As x approaches a value, y approaches another value
- Essentially coordinates for an undefined point
- Doesn't matter if actual value for that point is something else, limit is the same
- **Left hand limit is x->y^-**
- **Right hand limit is x->y^+**
- ***If left and right hand limits are not equal, the limit does not exist***
- Infinite Limits
    - If as x->x0, y increases continuously, then x->x0 = OO
    - Technically doesn't exist, but Master Frisbee Jesus wants us to answer infinity
    - If the value of the point is (nonzero)/0, there is a vertical asymptote and the limit is either OO or -OO
- As long as you don't break rules, you can use treat limits like normal numbers
- If you get a value that is 0/0, use algebra
    - Since we're taking a limit we don't care about restrictions
- Squeeze Theorem
    - If for all values of x, f(x) < g(x) < h(x) and lim(f) = lim(h), then lim(f) = lim(g)
