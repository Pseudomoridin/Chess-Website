## Continuity
### Does something have breaks
- All polynomials are continuous
- Function must exist
- Rational functions are continuous at all points except when it would cause you to divide by zero
- LHL and RHL must be equal for a function to be continuous at that point
- Intermediate Value Theorem:
    - If you have any continuous function between two points, the function will hit every y value between the two points.
- A function is continuous at a point when:
    - The point is on the line
    - The limit exists
