## Inverse Functions
### *Because Calculus wasn't confusing enough*
- Functions must pass both the horizontal and vertical line test
- If it doesn't, only look at the stuff that does
- Inverse trig functions only have ***ONE*** result
    - sin^-1 answer is between -pi/2 and pi/2
    - cos^-1 answer is between 0 and pi
    - tan^-1 answer is between -pi/2 and pi/2
- while inverse functions cancel, if there are restrictions on the domain, you need to actually do the work
