# **CHESS MACHINE LEARNING AI**
Chess AI that will learn how to play chess based on it moving randomly and being rewarded for different actions, weighted differently based on their importance. The AI will not play against itself, it needs a human to play against in order to learn.
#### *Runs on the website [__here__](https://Chess-Website.bryceelphingsto.repl.co)*
### ***The program is very unfinished. None of the files run yet and there's no AI. I'm working on it.***
